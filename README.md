# Vitrus Python SDK

A Python client for multi Agent-World-Actor orchestration, with easy-to-use spatial perception _Workflows_.
For detailed documentation and more examples access [Vitrus Docs](https://vitrus.gitbook.io/docs/concepts).

ðŸ’¡ Tip: If anything takes more than 2 minutes to setup, ask in our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/Xd5f6WSh).

## Installation

```bash
# Using pip
pip install vitrus

# Or install from source
pip install git+https://github.com/vitrus/vitrus-sdk-python.git
```

## Authentication

[Get an API Key](https://app.vitrus.ai)

```python
import asyncio
import os
from vitrus import Vitrus

async def main():
    # Initialize the client with all options
    vitrus = Vitrus(
        api_key=os.environ.get("VITRUS_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY"),
        # Optional parameters
        world=os.environ.get("VITRUS_WORLD_ID", "your_world_id"),  # Required for actors
        base_url="wss://vitrus-dao.onrender.com",  # Default value
        debug=False  # Set to True for debugging
    )
    
    # Authentication happens automatically when needed
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

# Workflows

**Workflows** have a similar schema as AI tools, so it connects perfectly with [OpenAI function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=chat). Making Workflows great to compose complex physical tasks with AI Agents. The following is a simple example of how to run a workflow:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from vitrus import Vitrus

async def main():
    vitrus = Vitrus(api_key=os.environ.get("VITRUS_API_KEY"))
    
    # List available workflows
    workflows = await vitrus.list_workflows()
    print("Available workflows:")
    for workflow in workflows:
        print(f"- {workflow['function']['name']}")
    
    # Run a basic workflow
    result = await vitrus.workflow("hello-world", {
        "prompt": "hello world!"
    })
    
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

Workflows are executed in Cloud GPUs (e.g. `Nvidia A100`), and combine multiple AI models for complex tasks.

## Available Workflows

We are continously updating the available workflows, and keeping them up to date with state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI models. Use `list_workflows()` to see all available workflows and their schemas.

# Worlds and Actors

Create a world at [app.vitrus.ai](https://app.vitrus.ai).

## Actors

Actors are entities that can receive and respond to commands within a world.

```python
import asyncio
import os
from vitrus import Vitrus

async def main():
    vitrus = Vitrus(
        api_key=os.environ.get("VITRUS_API_KEY"),
        world=os.environ.get("VITRUS_WORLD_ID")  # Required for actors
    )

    # Create an actor with metadata
    actor = await vitrus.actor("forest", {
        "human": "Tom Hanks",
        "eyes": "green"
    })

    # Register a command handler
    def walk(direction, speed=None):
        print(f"Received walk command: direction={direction}, speed={speed}")
        return f"run forest, run! Going {direction}" + (f" at {speed} speed" if speed else "")
    
    # Register the handler
    actor.on("walk", walk)
    
    print(f"Actor '{actor.name}' is listening for commands...")
    print("Press Ctrl+C to exit")
    
    # Keep the connection open
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nShutting down actor...")
        actor.disconnect()
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Agents

On the Agent side, once connected to a world, the actor can be treated as "functions".

```python
import asyncio
import os
from vitrus import Vitrus

async def main():
    vitrus = Vitrus(
        api_key=os.environ.get("VITRUS_API_KEY"),
        world=os.environ.get("VITRUS_WORLD_ID")  # Must match actor's world
    )

    # Get a handle to an actor without providing metadata
    # (This doesn't create the actor, just gives a handle to interact with it)
    actor = await vitrus.actor("forest")

    # Run a command on the actor with positional arguments
    response = await actor.run("walk", "north", "fast")
    print(f"Response: {response}")
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Scene Management

For spatial applications, you can manage scenes:

```python
import asyncio
from vitrus import Vitrus

async def main():
    vitrus = Vitrus(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", world="YOUR_WORLD_ID")
    
    # Get a scene
    scene = vitrus.scene("my-3d-environment")
    
    # Add an object to the scene
    scene.add({
        "id": "cube1",
        "type": "cube",
        "position": [0, 1, 0],
        "scale": [1, 1, 1]
    })
    
    # Update an object
    scene.update({
        "id": "cube1",
        "position": [0, 2, 0]
    })
    
    # Get the full scene
    scene_data = scene.get()
    print(scene_data)
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Error Handling

The SDK uses Python's exceptions for error handling:

```python
import asyncio
from vitrus import Vitrus

async def main():
    try:
        vitrus = Vitrus(api_key="INVALID_API_KEY")
        await vitrus.list_workflows()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Issues**
- Ensure your API key is valid
- Check that the world ID exists (if using actors)
- Verify your internet connection and any firewall settings
- Set `debug=True` to see detailed logs of the connection process

**Actor/Command Issues**
- Actor commands are case-sensitive
- Ensure the actor is registered in the world before running commands
- Parameter types should match what's expected by the handler

# How Vitrus works internally

Vitrus workflows, worlds, actors and agents run on top of Distributed Actor Orchestration (DAO). A lightweight cloud system that enables the cross-communication of agents-world-actors.
